When it comes to car buying and driving, many people seem to do the same thing over and over again. Some people buy a new car every year, while others only buy cars when they need one. Regardless of why someone buys a car, it’s important to be aware of some key points when purchasing one. First and foremost, buying a car should be an enjoyable experience. If it isn’t, you won’t be happy with your purchase. Second, make sure you have the correct size car for your needs. Many times people think they need a specific type of car because their parents or friends have them, but this isn’t always true.

When it comes to choosing between a car and public transportation, the cost of owning a car is often the deciding factor. While both options have their own benefits, a car can be more expensive to own than public transportation. Here are some key factors to consider when making this decision:

The average person spends around $2 per gallon of gasoline on their car, so if you drive an entire month without filling up, your car will most likely require less than $100 in gas each month. On the other hand, parking at a subway or train station costs about $4 for an hour or more.</p><p>-The cost of insurance.
