When you buy a car, the most important thing to remember is how to drive it and maintain it. Here are some tips on how to do both:</p><ol><li><p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask around for advice – Everyone has their own expertise and knowledge about cars, so ask around for help if you&rsquo;re not sure where to start.</p></li><li><p>Get a driver&rsquo;s license – Carrying a driver&rsquo;s license is one of the most important steps in maintaining your car. It will protect you from getting into an accident, and you&rsquo;ll also need it in case you ever have to take your car in for repair.</p></li><li><p>Be responsible – No one wants their car broken down or lost in the wrong district, so make sure you&rsquo;re always keeping your vehicle clean and inside its original condition.</p></li></ol><h2 id=there-probably-won039t-be-any-new-forza-games-next-year--carsradars>There Probably Won't Be Any New Forza Games Next Year | CarsRadars<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#there-probably-won039t-be-any-new-forza-games-next-year--carsradars>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://carsradars.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cautofoto27f070af12f2bfb936be6515f980bc95-300x158.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.O69Vze8o5ENwao_ttUNysgAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="There Probably Won't Be Any New Forza Games Next Year | CarsRadars"><p><em>Source: carsradars.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Restraint Devices: How cars keep you safe
The use of restraint devices in cars can keep drivers and passengers safe by restraining them while driving. There are many restraint devices that are available to drivers and passengers, but the most common is the airbag.
