Cars are the top contributor to the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, emitting more CO2 than all other vehicles combined. The average car emits about 231 lbs of CO2 every mile. And that’s just the inside of the car! The outside of a car produces an even larger amount of gases, such as nitrogen oxide and tailpipe emissions from the engine and driving accessories. A single-occupant vehicle in your neighborhood produces up to 26,500 lbs of CO2 each year!</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://soviresna.github.io/posts/bemer-motor-car/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Bemer Motor Car - Bemer Houston Tx Cars Motor Welcome</span></a>
