One of the most pressing issues facing our planet is how cars impact the environment. The amount of carbon emitted by a car is equivalent to burning 2400 trees, which is twice the amount of CO2 released in a year from an average coal-fired power plant.1 This means that cars are one of the leading contributors to climate change and their emissions must be reduced if we’re going to save the planet.
There are many ways to reduce the environmental impact of cars. One way is to switch to electric vehicles, which have lower emissions and create less pollution than gasoline or diesel vehicles. Another way is to install public transportation, which eliminates the need for car trips and saves on energy costs. Finally, companies like Tesla Motors are developing innovative new technologies that can help make cars environmentally friendly.</p><h2 id=is-your-car-leaking-gas-and-what-should-you-do-about-it---vehicle-hq>Is Your Car Leaking Gas?

There are over 1 billion cars on the road in the United States, and they’re getting larger by the day. In fact, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in 2016 there were more cars on the road than ever before. This increase in number is likely due to a variety of reasons, including an increase in vehicle ownership, faster-growing population, and an increasing need for space.
However, as with most things in life, there are also some risks associated with these cars on the roads. For example, as vehicles get bigger and more expensive, they become more vulnerable to theft or damage. Additionally, larger vehicles can be difficult to navigate around curves or intersections. And finally, large trucks and buses can pose a serious threat to both drivers and passengers if they don’t follow traffic laws.</p><h2 id=why-is-my-car-leaking-oil-when-parked-here039s-everything-you-need-to-know>Why Is My Car Leaking Oil When Parked?
