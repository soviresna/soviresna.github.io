There are over 1 billion cars on the road in the United States, and they’re getting larger by the day. In fact, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in 2016 there were more cars on the road than ever before. This increase in number is likely due to a variety of reasons, including an increase in vehicle ownership, faster-growing population, and an increasing need for space.
However, as with most things in life, there are also some risks associated with these cars on the roads. For example, as vehicles get bigger and more expensive, they become more vulnerable to theft or damage. Additionally, larger vehicles can be difficult to navigate around curves or intersections. And finally, large trucks and buses can pose a serious threat to both drivers and passengers if they don’t follow traffic laws.</p><h2 id=richard-rawlings--fast-n-loud--ガスモンキー-ロック画面用壁紙-乗り物>RICHARD RAWLINGS | FAST N LOUD | ガスモンキー, ロック画面用壁紙, 乗り物<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#richard-rawlings--fast-n-loud--ガスモンキー-ロック画面用壁紙-乗り物>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/20/3c/ae/203caef033d9f05cb32e4624c288e0d3.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.M0aOqSPMYgW0uJ6YZHd_UAHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt="RICHARD RAWLINGS | FAST N LOUD | ガスモンキー, ロック画面用壁紙, 乗り物"><p><em>Source: pinterest.fr</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Cars used in the U.S.
