Window size and function are important factors when it comes to driving. The average window size in a car is three inches, but this varies depending on the make of the car and model. Some cars have large windows that open all the way to the ground, while others have small windows that just touch the ground.
Most window sizes are determined by how high up you want your driver&rsquo;s seat to be. A car with an adjustable driver&rsquo;s seat will have different window sizes according to where in the world you sit. Some models even come with two sets of windows: one for front and one for backseat passengers.</p><p>Window size is also determined by how wide your car is.
