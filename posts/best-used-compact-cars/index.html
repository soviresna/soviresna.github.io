When it comes to cars, there are a few things that always have to be considered. Cost is one of them. Not only is the price of a car important when making a decision, but also the cost of repairs and replacements.

That’s why we wanted to simplify things by taking an average cost of buying or leasing a car in the United States and specializing in lease deals for cars. Here are the results: The average price for a brand new car in America is $27,390. This number jumps to $45,690 if you buy or lease a car with aury money down.

-The price of gasoline. The average person spends around $2 per gallon of gasoline on their car, so if you drive an entire month without filling up, your car will most likely require less than $100 in gas each month. On the other hand, parking at a subway or train station costs about $4 for an hour or more.</p><p>-The cost of insurance.
