There are over 1 billion cars on the road in the United States, and they’re getting larger by the day. In fact, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in 2016 there were more cars on the road than ever before.

However, as with most things in life, there are also some risks associated with these cars on the roads. For example, as vehicles get bigger and more expensive, they become more vulnerable to theft or damage. Additionally, larger vehicles can be difficult to navigate around curves or intersections. And finally, large trucks and buses can pose a serious threat to both drivers and passengers if they don’t follow traffic laws.</p><h2 id=in-texas-fires-120000-acres-68-homes-burn-and-one-death>In Texas Fires, 120,000 Acres, 68 Homes Burn, And One Death<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#in-texas-fires-120000-acres-68-homes-burn-and-one-death>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://wildfiretoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Texas-fatal-accident.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.YlNMRUxyQ4UsSZEa6QcV6gAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="In Texas fires, 120,000 acres, 68 homes burn, and one death"><p><em>Source: wildfiretoday.com</em></p><blockquote><p>texas crash accident fatal cameron crane mrt midland burn acres death homes truck fires caused primera roger killed contributor grassfire.</p></blockquote><p>What makes cars so special?
