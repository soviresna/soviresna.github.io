When it comes to choosing between a car and public transportation, the cost of owning a car is often the deciding factor. While both options have their own benefits, a car can be more expensive to own than public transportation. Here are some key factors to consider when making this decision:
-The price of gasoline. The average person spends around $2 per gallon of gasoline on their car, so if you drive an entire month without filling up, your car will most likely require less than $100 in gas each month. On the other hand, parking at a subway or train station costs about $4 for an hour or more.</p><p>-The cost of insurance. If you want to buy a car that has liability insurance, you&rsquo;ll need to factor in the cost of this type of coverage as well.</p><h2 id=traxxas-rc-cars-under-100-of-2021-full-overview--buying-guide-2>Traxxas RC Cars Under $100 Of 2021 Full Overview | Buying Guide<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#traxxas-rc-cars-under-100-of-2021-full-overview--buying-guide-2>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B08BNW649C&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=bestusa00-20" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.exuqfTBJxoAsQiBOPUeNRAAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Traxxas RC Cars Under $100 of 2021 Full Overview | Buying Guide"><p><em>Source: best-usa-goods.com</em></p><blockquote><p>traxxas.</p></blockquote><p>Cars are a means of transportation that have been around for centuries.
